## Overview[¶](https://haugene.github.io/docker-transmission-openvpn/#overview "Permanent link")

You have found the documentation. That usually means that you either:

1.  Want to read a bit about how the image is built and how it works
2.  Want to get started, and are looking for a setup guide
3.  Already have a setup, but something is broken

We'll try to address them here but no matter which one of them it is, knowing more about this image makes it easier to understand how it should be and what could be wrong. So starting with number 1 is never a bad idea.

**NB:** These pages are under re-construction. Follow the issue [here](https://github.com/haugene/docker-transmission-openvpn/issues/1558) and feel free to comment or help out :) Also we just released version 3.0, so if you have some breakage - [please read here](https://haugene.github.io/docker-transmission-openvpn/v3/).
