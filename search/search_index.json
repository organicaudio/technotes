maven and ci Maven revisions Stackoverflow local vs. remote Repo maven uses a local and a remote repository. By default the local repo is located under: ~/.m2/repository The default remote repo is located under: https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ The remote repository can be defined in the the user ~/.m2/settings.xml or in the pom.xml or the global ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml . The precedence of the defined repositories in a xml file is from top to down. The files have the following precedence: Global settings.xml User settings.xml Local POM Parent POMs, recursively Super POM which depends on the used maven version You can define mirrors in the settings.xml which will redirect specific or wildcard repositories to another one. The mirrorOf element contains the id of the repository you want to redirect (or a wildcard * ) and an url element which points to the target repository. repository mirrors https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html is set in settings.xml redirects traffic of an Repository via mirrorOf to another url package vs install vs deploy mvn package builds a project and save the artifacts in the target folder. mvn install calls the package command and save the artifacts in the local .m2 repo. mvn deploy calls the install command and save the artifacts in the remote repo, which is defined in the <distributionManagement> xml element in the settings.xml. In order to resolve dependencies they must exist in the local or the remote repo. The exception are dependencies on projects, which are build together. parent vs. aggregator pom Combinations of parent and aggregator poms are possible. A aggregator pom allows to build multiple projects. ... <modules> <module>artifactID-A</modules> <module>artifactID-b</modules> </modules> ... A parent pom is referenced from within a child via the <parent> element. The child project inherits the dependencies,the plugins and defined repositories. These can be overwritten in the child pom if needed. ... <parent> <groupId>parentGroupId</groupId> <artifactId>parentID</artifactId> <version>1.0.0</version> </parent> ... importing projects An alternative to a parent project is to import a project. This mechanism allows to import multiple projects instead of one as is possible via parent pom mechanism. This is accomplished by declaring a pom artifact as a dependency with a scope of \"import\" in the dependencyManagement section. ... <dependencyManagement> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId>maven</groupId> <artifactId>A</artifactId> <version>1.0</version> <type>pom</type> <scope>import</scope> </dependency> </dependencies> </dependencyManagement> ... </project> ... dependencies vs. dependencyManagement The use of dependencyManagement only makes sense if it is used in a parent pom. It is used to manage the versions of dependencies across multiple projects. Dependencies defined in dependencyManagement are not used during a maven build. To do so they need to be included in dependencies block, but the version tag of the dependency can no be omitted in the dependencies block because it is already defined in dependencyManagement block. plugin vs. pluginManagement Works like dependencies/ dependencyManagementsee only for plugins. goals and phases There is a nice overview under: https://www.baeldung.com/maven-goals-phases mvn help:describe -Dcmd=package shows the lifecylce phases of a project and which maven plugins run when. SNAPTSHOT-version vs version use case Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5901378/what-exactly-is-a-maven-snapshot-and-why-do-we-need-it A snapshot version in maven is one that has not been released. The idea is that before a 1.0 release (or any other release) is done, there exists a 1.0-SNAPSHOT. That version is what might become 1.0. It's basically \"1.0 under development\". This might be close to a real 1.0 release, or pretty far (right after the 0.9 release, for example). The difference between a \"real\" version and a snapshot version is that snapshots might get updates. That means that downloading 1.0-SNAPSHOT today might give a different file than downloading it yesterday or tomorrow. Usually, snapshot dependencies should only exist during development and no released version (i.e. no non-snapshot) should have a dependency on a snapshot version. behaviour Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5901378/what-exactly-is-a-maven-snapshot-and-why-do-we-need-it When you build an application, maven will search for dependencies in the local repository. If a stable version is not found there, it will search the remote repositories (defined in settings.xml or pom.xml) to retrieve this dependency. Then, it will copy it into the local repository, to make it available for the next builds. For example, a foo-1.0.jar library is considered as a stable version, and if maven finds it in the local repository, it will use this one for the current build. Now, if you need a foo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar library, maven will know that this version is not stable and is subject to changes. That's why maven will try to find a newer version in the remote repositories, even if a version of this library is found on the local repository. However, this check is made only once per day. That means that if you have a foo-1.0-20110506.110000-1.jar (i.e. this library has been generated on 2011/05/06 at 11:00:00) in your local repository, and if you run the maven build again the same day, maven will not check the repositories for a newer version. known errors in with parent pom projects Maven: Failed to read artifact descriptor Cause: The parent pom project needs to be build so the pom can be uploaded into local and/or remote repo Solution: run mvn install or mvn deploy to save the pom in local or remote repo.","title":"maven memory aid"},{"location":"default/maven-memory-aid/#maven-memory-aid","text":"CLI options reference","title":"maven memory aid"},{"location":"default/maven-memory-aid/#useful-commands","text":"mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=de.weyrich.MainClassName mvn help:system prints system properties and environment variables. mvn help:effective-settings print settings. mvn help:effective-pom creates a pom which is used after the interpolation, inheritance and use of active profiles.","title":"useful commands"},{"location":"default/maven-memory-aid/#maven-and-ci","text":"Maven revisions Stackoverflow","title":"maven and ci"},{"location":"default/maven-memory-aid/#local-vs-remote-repo","text":"maven uses a local and a remote repository.

The idea is that before a 1.0 release (or any other release) is done, there exists a 1.0-SNAPSHOT. That version is what might become 1.0. It's basically \"1.0 under development\". This might be close to a real 1.0 release, or pretty far (right after the 0.9 release, for example). The difference between a \"real\" version and a snapshot version is that snapshots might get updates. That means that downloading 1.0-SNAPSHOT today might give a different file than downloading it yesterday or tomorrow.

If a stable version is not found there, it will search the remote repositories (defined in settings.xml or pom.xml) to retrieve this dependency. Then, it will copy it into the local repository, to make it available for the next builds. For example, a foo-1.0.jar library is considered as a stable version, and if maven finds it in the local repository, it will use this one for the current build. Now, if you need a foo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar library, maven will know that this version is not stable and is subject to changes. That's why maven will try to find a newer version in the remote repositories, even if a version of this library is found on the local repository. However, this check is made only once per day. That means that if you have a foo-1.0-20110506.110000-1.jar (i.e. this library has been generated on 2011/05/06 at 11:00:00) in your local repository, and if you run the maven build again the same day, maven will not check the repositories for a newer version.","title":"behaviour"},{"location":"default/maven-memory-aid/#known-errors-in-with-parent-pom-projects","text":"Maven: Failed to read artifact descriptor Cause: The parent pom project needs to be build so the pom can be uploaded into local and/or remote repo Solution: run mvn install or mvn deploy to save the pom in local or remote repo.","title":"known errors in with parent pom projects"},{"location":"default/mockito-memoery-aid/","text":"Mockito memory aid rule of thumb: Do not mock types you don\u2019t own might seem obvious but do not mock the class under test.

Nearly all iOS apps assign themselves one of these names, and you need to know them if you want to add custom icons to your home screen or create a Shortcuts workflow that opens an app on your iPhone up. Finding the URL scheme name, also known as a URI scheme, for a particular app is not easy. First, you have to download the IPA file for the app \u2014 a difficult task since the iTunes 12.7 update removed iOS apps from it. When you finally find the IPA, you have to turn it into a ZIP file, show the contents of the app package, then hunt for the specific PLIST file that contains the URL schemes. It's a lot of work. This example shows the URL schemes for VSCO in one of its PLIST files. You can take some of the work out of digging through IPAs by downloading the extract-scheme-url.sh script on your Mac and running bash extract-scheme-url.sh AppName.ipa in a terminal window in the directory where those files are. As for the IPAs, the easiest way to download IPA files is to use Apple Configurator 2. After signing in and connecting your iPhone, you can view and update apps that need it. Any apps you update this way will be stored temporarily in an Apple Config folder in the \"Group Containers\" folder in your user library. But it's still a lot of work and requires that the app you need has an update you can apply. \u2022 More Info: How to Download IPA Files for the iOS Apps on Your iPhone If all you want to do is create a custom app icon or open the Netflix app from a workflow you're toying with, we'll try to make things as easy as possible for you by listing below all of the URL scheme names for apps that we know of right now. Also, when we come across them, we'll not only include the \"open\" schemes, but some deep links URL schemes to jump to specific tasks inside an app. While the list below may seem small considering there are over 2 million apps in the App Store, it's a work in progress, and we'll keep adding to it as we discover more URL schemes for popular apps and games on iPhone. \u2022 Don't Miss: How to Customize iOS App Icons Without Jailbreaking Your iPhone Quick Guide to Using URL Schemes in Shortcuts Before moving on to the list, let's do a quick lesson on using URL schemes in the Shortcuts app. When iOS 13 came out, Shortcuts removed the need to use any \"open\" URL schemes since it added a new \"Open App\" script that will let you choose any app on your iPhone. That makes things so much easier. Still, if you prefer the old way, want to use deep links, or want to know the base URL scheme to investigate for possible deep links, check out the first screenshot below. You input the URL scheme into the \"URL\" web action, then use the \"Open URLs\" web action below it to perform the task. It's essentially the same as using the \"Open App\" script seen in the second screenshot below. URL schemes are more handy for deep links where you want to perform a specific action. As seen below, you can see I'm opening up the \"Customize Controls\" settings in the \"Control Center\" preferences. URL Schemes for Popular iOS Apps & Services Any ones below without anything after the :// are just schemes to open the apps up, while ones with information after the :// are for performing \"deep link\" specific actions within the apps. Also, while all of the below include the :// in them, most can be used with just : instead of with the // symbols. Keep in mind that developers may change the URL schemes for their apps at any time. Apple has done so for certain iOS services, such as links to specific settings, with each new iOS update (iOS 11, iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, etc.). Some URL schemes you can probably even guess since a lot just use their app's name as the scheme name. Trial and error! Schemes for the Settings app (listed below) are merely paths to Settings menus. Apple restricts schemes from being able to toggle switches on and off, select different features from a list, and so on. It does so for security purposes, so that runaway apps or shortcuts don't alter your settings without you realizing it. Also, anything below that starts with fb :// are Facebook deep links that should work whether or not you have Facebook installed on your device. Since they don't always work as expected, we've only included them in the list below if they had no other URL scheme name. Otherwise, fb :// schemes are omitted.

We encourage the support of our community to help us build this list up! Also, it's worth noting that Apple has been trying to wean developers off URL schemes since iOS 9.2 in favor of universal links, but URL schemes are nowhere near dead. And with Apple turning Workflow into its own Shortcuts app starting in iOS 12, an app that even has its own scheme, there's no reason to believe URL schemes are going away anytime soon.

Nearly all iOS apps assign themselves one of these names, and you need to know them if you want to add custom icons to your home screen or create a Shortcuts workflow that opens an app on your iPhone up. Finding the URL scheme name, also known as a URI scheme, for a particular app is not easy. First, you have to download the IPA file for the app \u2014 a difficult task since the iTunes 12.7 update removed iOS apps from it. When you finally find the IPA, you have to turn it into a ZIP file, show the contents of the app package, then hunt for the specific PLIST file that contains the URL schemes. It's a lot of work. This example shows the URL schemes for VSCO in one of its PLIST files. You can take some of the work out of digging through IPAs by downloading the extract-scheme-url.sh script on your Mac and running bash extract-scheme-url.sh AppName.ipa in a terminal window in the directory where those files are. As for the IPAs, the easiest way to download IPA files is to use Apple Configurator 2. After signing in and connecting your iPhone, you can view and update apps that need it. Any apps you update this way will be stored temporarily in an Apple Config folder in the \"Group Containers\" folder in your user library. But it's still a lot of work and requires that the app you need has an update you can apply. \u2022 More Info: How to Download IPA Files for the iOS Apps on Your iPhone If all you want to do is create a custom app icon or open the Netflix app from a workflow you're toying with, we'll try to make things as easy as possible for you by listing below all of the URL scheme names for apps that we know of right now. Also, when we come across them, we'll not only include the \"open\" schemes, but some deep links URL schemes to jump to specific tasks inside an app. While the list below may seem small considering there are over 2 million apps in the App Store, it's a work in progress, and we'll keep adding to it as we discover more URL schemes for popular apps and games on iPhone. \u2022 Don't Miss: How to Customize iOS App Icons Without Jailbreaking Your iPhone Quick Guide to Using URL Schemes in Shortcuts Before moving on to the list, let's do a quick lesson on using URL schemes in the Shortcuts app. When iOS 13 came out, Shortcuts removed the need to use any \"open\" URL schemes since it added a new \"Open App\" script that will let you choose any app on your iPhone. That makes things so much easier. Still, if you prefer the old way, want to use deep links, or want to know the base URL scheme to investigate for possible deep links, check out the first screenshot below. You input the URL scheme into the \"URL\" web action, then use the \"Open URLs\" web action below it to perform the task. It's essentially the same as using the \"Open App\" script seen in the second screenshot below. URL schemes are more handy for deep links where you want to perform a specific action. As seen below, you can see I'm opening up the \"Customize Controls\" settings in the \"Control Center\" preferences. URL Schemes for Popular iOS Apps & Services Any ones below without anything after the :// are just schemes to open the apps up, while ones with information after the :// are for performing \"deep link\" specific actions within the apps. Also, while all of the below include the :// in them, most can be used with just : instead of with the // symbols. Keep in mind that developers may change the URL schemes for their apps at any time. Apple has done so for certain iOS services, such as links to specific settings, with each new iOS update (iOS 11, iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, etc.). Some URL schemes you can probably even guess since a lot just use their app's name as the scheme name. Trial and error! Schemes for the Settings app (listed below) are merely paths to Settings menus. Apple restricts schemes from being able to toggle switches on and off, select different features from a list, and so on. It does so for security purposes, so that runaway apps or shortcuts don't alter your settings without you realizing it. Also, anything below that starts with fb :// are Facebook deep links that should work whether or not you have Facebook installed on your device. Since they don't always work as expected, we've only included them in the list below if they had no other URL scheme name. Otherwise, fb :// schemes are omitted.

Also, it's worth noting that Apple has been trying to wean developers off URL schemes since iOS 9.2 in favor of universal links, but URL schemes are nowhere near dead. And with Apple turning Workflow into its own Shortcuts app starting in iOS 12, an app that even has its own scheme, there's no reason to believe URL schemes are going away anytime soon.

Supervision of devices can be performed while enrolling them in Mobile Device Manager Plus using DEP Enrollment and Apple Configurator. There are cases when the devices are brought under management without supervising them and these devices are in use, supervising these devices by re-enrolling them leads to loss of the data present in the device. This document provides the steps to supervise devices that are in use without losing the data present in the devices. NOTE: Apple recommends that the device to be supervised be reset and re-enrolled but as this may not be feasible in most cases, the following method serves as a work around. Requirements: Device to be supervised- main device A temporary device to back up data- temp device (This device may or may not be enrolled with MDM) Apple Configurator/ Apple DEP Using Apple Configurator: Ensure that the settings Remove apps on profile removal, Restrict App data backup is unchecked when the apps were distributed. Back up the main device using iTunes. (No third party backups like iMazing) Restore this content on a temporary device which can be either supervised or unsupervised. Back up the temporary device using iTunes. Restore the backup of the temporary device into the device to be supervised. After restoration, on the setup screen, connect the device to Apple Configurator and enroll it using the steps mentioned here. All the app data is restored in the enrolled device and the MDM profile is installed with the new Apple Configurator profile. The enrolled device will be awaiting user assignment and profile distribution. The apps will have to be brought under management again. Prepare Applie Configurator 2.0 On Apple Configurator 2, click File, select New Profile and then select Wi-Fi. Do not modify any other profiles as this might affect the profiles distributed using MDM. Create a Wi-Fi profile and save it. Click File and choose New Blueprint and name it. Open the newly created Blueprint and click Profiles, you have to add the newly created Wi-Fi profile (which was created in step #2). Right-click and choose Prepare as shown in the below image. Specify the Configuration Type as Manual. If you wish to add mobile devices into your Apple Business Manager (ABM) portal from Apple Configurator 2, enable the Add to Device Enrollment Program option. Learn how, from this document. Add the new server details by specifying the Server Name and Enrollment URL, configured in the MDM server. Trust anchor certificates are automatically added. If Apple Configurator takes too long to fetch anchor certificates, skip and proceed directly to the Assign to organization step by clicking on Next. [Disable Supervised Mode] How to remove iOS supervision and release devices in Apple Business Manager https://www.miradore.com/knowledge/ios/how-to-remove-iphone-ipad-supervision/ How to tell if an iPad or iPhone is supervised? On the device, go to Settings > General > About. The device is supervised if you see a text saying \u201cThis iPad/iPhone is supervised and managed by (company name)\u201d. How to disable supervision on an iPhone or iPad? In most cases, only the institution which owns the device can turn off the supervised mode. Unenrolling or retiring devices from the MDM does not make them unsupervised. A device can be enrolled in supervision two ways: Apple Configurator & Apple DEP. The supervised mode can be removed by resetting/wiping the device to factory settings (Erase all content and settings) if the supervised mode was enabled using Apple Configurator. If the device is still supervised after a factory reset, then it has been automatically enrolled and supervised using Apple Business Manager / DEP. The unenrollment will need to be retired from the DEP's console. How to remove iOS devices from Apple Business Manager Sometimes you may want to remove an iPad or iPhone from Apple Business Manager entirely, for example, if the device is lost, sold or broken. You can do that by following the guidance provided on the Apple Business Manager User Guide. It explains how you can release iOS devices in Apple Business Manager. https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/apple-business-manager/asmec4d28461/web How To Supervise An iPhone Without Erasing Data (2018) https://www.tecklyfe.com/how-to-supervise-an-iphone-without-erasing-data/","title":"iOS Supervised Manage Devices / MDM"},{"location":"ios/iOS%20Supervised%20Manage%20Devices%20MDM/#ios-supervised-manage-devices-mdm","text":"","title":"iOS Supervised Manage Devices / MDM"},{"location":"ios/iOS%20Supervised%20Manage%20Devices%20MDM/#enable-supervised-mode-how-to-supervise-managed-devices-without-data-loss","text":"https://www.manageengine.com/mobile-device-management-msp/how-to/supervising-managed-unsupervised-devices.html","title":"[Enable Supervised Mode] How to supervise managed devices without data loss?"},{"location":"ios/iOS%20Supervised%20Manage%20Devices%20MDM/#problem","text":"Supervision of iOS mobile devices provides IT admins additional control over these devices.

NOTE: Apple recommends that the device to be supervised be reset and re-enrolled but as this may not be feasible in most cases, the following method serves as a work around.","title":"Problem:"},{"location":"ios/iOS%20Supervised%20Manage%20Devices%20MDM/#requirements","text":"Device to be supervised- main device A temporary device to back up data- temp device (This device may or may not be enrolled with MDM) Apple Configurator/ Apple DEP","title":"Requirements:"},{"location":"ios/iOS%20Supervised%20Manage%20Devices%20MDM/#using-apple-configurator","text":"Ensure that the settings Remove apps on profile removal, Restrict App data backup is unchecked when the apps were distributed.

Back up the temporary device using iTunes. Restore the backup of the temporary device into the device to be supervised. After restoration, on the setup screen, connect the device to Apple Configurator and enroll it using the steps mentioned here. All the app data is restored in the enrolled device and the MDM profile is installed with the new Apple Configurator profile. The enrolled device will be awaiting user assignment and profile distribution.

Unenrolling or retiring devices from the MDM does not make them unsupervised. A device can be enrolled in supervision two ways: Apple Configurator & Apple DEP. The supervised mode can be removed by resetting/wiping the device to factory settings (Erase all content and settings) if the supervised mode was enabled using Apple Configurator. If the device is still supervised after a factory reset, then it has been automatically enrolled and supervised using Apple Business Manager / DEP.

It allows to inject values from a property file or a environmental variable into a filed or a parameter. It supports the spring expressions language (SPELL). To import a property of a property file: @PropertySource(\"classpath:/application.property\") @Value(\"${property.name}\") private String example; To import a environmental property: @Value(\"${environmental_property_name}\") private String example; profiles Spring profiles allow you to load alternate configurations based on environment variables With @Profile() a bean can be added to a specific profile environmental variable to control the spring profile: spring.profiles.active You can set profile via: Context parameter in web.xml ( <ontext-param> <param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name><param-value>...</param-value></context-param> ) WebApplicationInitializer JVM System parameter (spring.profiles.active) Environment variable (spring.profiles.active) Maven profile ( ) @ActiveProfile for unit test You can read profile via: Environment class @Value(spring.profiles.active) Examples how to activate profile from cli: # as jvm parameter java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev app.jar # as application arguments java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev # as maven profile spring boot mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev # as maven profile spring mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.profiles=dev spring expression language SPELL examples: read environmental variables: \"${environmental_variable_name}\" Object creation \"#{new Boolean(environment['spring.profiles.active'] == 'dev')\" bean scopes To explicitly use a scope add @Scope() to Bean. Scopes: singleton bean (default) prototype bean: new instance every time it is referenced sessions scoped bean (web) request scoped bean (web) proxies proxies add behavior to beans like caching or transactions are only used if the bean is instantiated by spring Annotation-based configuration component scan Annotation-based configuration/ component scanning is an alternative to adding beans to Application context via @Bean or xml config. You need to add @ComponentScan to a class. The annotation without arguments tells Spring to scan the current package and all of its sub-packages for classes which are annotated witch @Component or other stereotypes. The Component annotation is a so called generic stereotype , which is used to mark a class which should be instantiated by the BeanFactory. The other stereotypes are Controller , Service and Repository , which are specializations of the @Component class. Some stereotypes bring default proxies with them. Use @Autowire to inject a bean. The @Qualifier Annotation can be used if there are multiple implementations for a bean interface. autowiring field level injection: is not good because it is hard to test/ mock can not control the construction setter level injection: for optional dependecies for changing dependecies (mutable variables) constructor level injection: preferred method immutable lifecycle methods @PostConstruct is used on a void-method and is called after the initialization of a bean. @PreDestroy is used on a void-method and is called before the bean is destroyed. The annotations are part of java ee and therefore removed in java 11. To use them you must define them as depdency: <dependency> <groupId>javax.annotation</groupId> <artifactId>javax.annotation-api</artifactId> <version>1.3.2</version> </dependency> xml-based config (legacy) It is legacy . xml elements are used for beans attributes and sub-elements are used for configuration of beans xml namespaces are used typical names are: application-config.xml, mvc-config.xml, web-application-config.xml bean lifecycle Initialization use destroy Initialization varies for the three ways beans can be defined. This one is for xml, but it is similar to the two other ways: Create ApplicationContext which wraps the BeanFactory Initialize the BeanFactory Load Bean definitions (via java config, xml config, autoconfig and component scanning) BeanFactory Post-Processing (resolve SPELL or interpolation from property files) Foreach bean: init constructor setter (and fields) Bean Post-Processing pre init init post init aspects Aspects are: cross cutting concerns reusable blocks of code e.g. logging, security, transaction management, caching Spring uses AspectJ for Aspect oriented programming (AOP), which uses byte code modification (runtime interweaving). If (vanilla) spring is used @EnableAspectJAutoProxy needs to be added to the Configuration class. An alternative for AspekctJ are JavaEE CDI interceptors (they are simpler but less flebile and apsectj is spring native). Nomenclature Joint point - code where advice is used Pointcut - selects a joint point Advice - code that is exectuted at join point Aspect - Module containing pointcuts and advice @Aspect is used to mark a class to show that it contains pointcuts and advice.

How do I use apk command line utility for the package management on Apline Linux server running in cloud or a Linux container? How can I use the apk command for the package management? Alpine Linux is a free and open source Linux-based distro. It uses musl and busybox. It is designed with security in mind and targeted at power users who wants secure distro out of the box. It uses PaX and grsecurity for Linux kernel protection. All binaries are compiled with stack smashing protection. APK stands for Alpine Linux package manager. You use the apk command to delete, install, upgrade, or list software on a running Alpine Linux based system. Like most modern Linux distro all software packages for Alpine Linux are digitally signed to avoid security problems. You can install packages from local disk (such as CDROM or a USB stick) or the internet archive location (repositories) such as http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.5/main. The list of repositories is stored in /etc/apk/repositories configuration file. Use the [cat command] to view /etc/apk/repositories file i.e. type cat /etc/apk/repositories. Alpine Linux package often has the .apk extension and called as \u201ca-packs\u201d. The apk command is equivalent to [apt command] / [apt-get command] on Debian/Ubuntu on [yum command] on CentOS Linux. Purpose Use apk for installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing apps/programs for an Alpine Linux operating system in a consistent manner. Syntax The basic syntax is as follows: apk [options] command apk [options] command pkgName apk [options] command pkgName1 pkgName2 Alpine Linux apk command examples Let us see how to use the apk command to install security updates or new set of packages on an Alpine Linux server. How to update the package list To update your package list, enter: # apk update Sample outputs: Fig.01: How to update the package list in Alpine Linux How to search for package(s) The syntax is: # apk search pkgName For example, search a package named htop, run: # apk search htop Sample outputs: htop-doc-2.0.2-r0 htop-2.0.2-r0 To search and display description: # apk search -v -d 'htop' Sample outputs: htop-doc-2.0.2-r0 - An interactive process viewer (documentation) htop-2.0.2-r0 - An interactive process viewer To list all packages available, along with their descriptions # apk search -v Sample outputs: gettext-0.19.8.1-r0 - GNU locale utilities gst-plugins-base0.10-dev-0.10.36-r3 - GStreamer Multimedia Framework Base Plugins (development files) xcb-util-keysyms-dev-0.4.0-r0 - Utility libraries for XC Binding - keysyms (development files) openlibm-0.5.4-r0 - High quality system independent, portable, open source libm implementation imapsync-doc-1.727-r1 - IMAP synchronisation, sync, copy or migration tool (documentation) evince-lang-3.22.1-r0 - Languages for package evince jack-1.9.10-r2 - The Jack Audio Connection Kit php7-intl-7.0.16-r0 - PHP7 extension: intl php5-5.6.30-r0 - The PHP language runtime engine samba-libs-4.5.7-r0 - Samba core libraries gst-plugins-bad1-1.8.3-r0 - GStreamer bad plugins docker-bash-completion-1.12.6-r0 - Bash completion for Docker mesa-gl-12.0.3-r0 - Mesa libGL runtime libraries nagios-plugins-mrtg-2.1.4-r2 - Nagios plugin check_mrtg ..... .. .... nrpe-2.15-r4 - NRPE allows you to remotely execute Nagios plugins on other Linux/Unix machines. py2-psycopg2-2.6.2-r1 - A Python-PostgreSQL Database Adapter (for python2) perl-mime-types-2.13-r0 - Definition of MIME types perl-net-http-doc-6.09-r0 - Net::HTTP perl module (documentation) shared-mime-info-lang-1.8-r0 - Languages for package shared-mime-info altermime-0.3.11-r0 - alterMIME - MIME encoded email pack alteration tool at-3.1.20-r0 - AT and batch delayed command scheduling utility and daemon fbida-2.12-r0 - Few applications to display and elementary edit images How do I search package by wildcards?

Do you want to continue [Y/n]? Simulation with apk command We can simulate the requested operation without making any changes. Helpful to see what packages will be upgrades or what will be done on the Alpine Linux system: `# apk -s command apk -s add nginx apk -s upgrade` In other words, nothing was installed or upgraded on the system, but you will know precisely what apk was about to do. How to hold a specific package back and not upgrade it If you want to upgrade Alpine Linux system, but keep or hold a specific package add version number. For instance, to hold the bash package to the version 5.0.0-r0 level or lower, run: # apk add bash**=**5.0.0-r0 One can do regex based version matching to hold the version to a major/minor release. For example: # apk add bash**=~**5.0 Now, upgrade the system. However, apk will upgrade the entire system, keeping the bash package at the 5.0.0-r0 or lower level: # apk upgrade It is possible to remove holding.

GNU Core Utilities are optional) Default user interface Command-line interface Official website alpinelinux.org Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox , designed for security, simplicity, and resource efficiency. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] It uses OpenRC for its init system and compiles all user-space binaries as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection . [8] Because of its small size, it is commonly used in containers providing quick boot-up times. [9] History[ edit ] Originally, Alpine Linux began as a fork of the LEAF Project . [1] The members of LEAF wanted to continue making a Linux distribution that could fit on a single floppy disk, whereas the Alpine Linux wished to include some more heavyweight packages: Squid and Samba . They also add security features and a newer kernel.

Alpine currently contains most commonly used packages such as GNOME , Xfce , Firefox , and others. Alpine Linux can be installed as a run-from-RAM operating system. The LBU (Alpine Local Backup) [13] tool optionally allows all configuration files to be backed up to an APK overlay file (usually shortened to apkovl ), a tar.gz file that by default stores a copy of all changed files in /etc (with the option to add more directories). This allows Alpine to work reliably in demanding embedded environments or to (temporarily) survive partial disk failures as sometimes experienced in public cloud environments. A hardened kernel was included in the default distribution for up to and including Alpine 3.7, which aids in reducing the impact of exploits and vulnerabilities. All packages are also compiled with stack-smashing protection to help mitigate the effects of userland buffer overflows . By default, it includes patches that allow using efficient meshed VPNs using the DMVPN standard. It has reliably had excellent support of Xen hypervisors in up-to-date versions, which avoids issues as experienced with Enterprise Distributions. (The standard Linux hypervisor KVM, is also available.) It allows very small Linux containers , around 8 MB in size, while a minimal installation to disk might be around 130 MB. [14] Alpine Configuration Framework (ACF): While optional, ACF is an application for configuring an Alpine Linux machine, with goals similar to Debian's debconf . It is a standard framework based on simple Lua scripts. [15] It previously used uClibc as its C standard library instead of the traditional GNU C Library (glibc) most commonly used. Although it is more lightweight, it does have the significant drawback of being binary incompatible with glibc. Thus, all software must be compiled for use with uClibc to work properly. As of 9 April 2014, [16] Alpine Linux switched to musl , which is partially binary compatible with glibc. [17] The lightweight OpenRC is the init system currently used by Alpine Linux. [18] Unlike many distributions, including Debian , Ubuntu , RHEL , Arch Linux and CentOS , Alpine does not use systemd .

Setup a Multi-Output Device How can I change the volume of a Multi-Output device? Unfortunately macOS does not support changing the volume of a Multi-Output device but you can set the volume of individual devices in Audio MIDI Setup. Why is nothing playing through BlackHole? Check System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Microphone to make sure your digital audio workstation (DAW) has microphone access. Check that the volume is all the way up on BlackHole input and output in Audio Midi Setup .

Ghost(Pro) users commonly route their DNS through Cloudflare for its support of root level CNAMEs and flexible redirects, known as page rules. The following steps will walk you through how to setup a root domain or subdomain with your Ghost(Pro) publication, using Cloudflare to manage your domain's DNS records. Regardless of how a user enters your publication's URL in their browser, they'll always be directed to the correct site. Step 1: Connect Your Domain to Cloudflare The first step for both types of configuration is to create a free Cloudflare account and follow a few steps. There are paid options available but you only need a free account to setup a custom domain with Ghost. Enter your domain name when creating your new Cloudflare account and it will query your existing DNS records and port them over. Review these records and port any over that are required. Update your Nameserver (NS) with your domain provider to the NS records that Cloudflare requests during the setup process. If you're unsure where to update this you may need to contact your domain provider directly: When your Cloudflare Overview shows a status of \"Active\" you are ready to configure your domain's DNS to point to your Ghost(Pro) publication - this can take a few minutes: Step 2: Create a CNAME record Before configuring a custom domain with your publication, decide whether you want to use a subdomain or root domain as the default URL for your site. What is a Subdomain? A subdomain is a subdivision of your domain name. For example, if you want to use Ghost(Pro) at blog.ghost.org, \u201c blog ,\u201d would be a subdomain of ghost.org . The most common subdomain is \u201c www \u201d e.g. www.ghost.org . What is a Root Domain? A root domain, also known as a \u201cnaked domain,\u201d is a domain without a subdomain in front, e.g. ghost.org is a root domain. Whether you use a root domain or subdomain with your publication is a matter of personal preference, however there are different setup steps for each that must be followed. Subdomain Setup To use a subdomain with your publication (e.g. www.domain.com ) go to your DNS settings in Cloudflare and create the following DNS records, ensuring the Proxy Status is set to DNS Only : Subdomain DNS Configuration Record Type Host Value CNAME www <subdomain>.ghost.io A @ 178.128.137.126 Root Domain Setup If you'd prefer to use a root domain (e.g. domain.com ), go to your DNS settings in Cloudflare and create the following DNS records, ensuring the Proxy Status is set to DNS Only : Root Domain DNS Configuration Record Type Host Value CNAME @ <subdomain>.ghost.io A www 178.128.137.126 Step 3: Activate the Custom Domain Login to your publication's Ghost Admin area, and go to the Ghost(Pro) > Domain settings.

It is highly recommended to run your BitTorrent client over VPN to protect your online privacy, and one of the best ways to do this is by using VPN Split Tunnel where only Transmission's traffic will be routed over VPN connection and you will retain your direct connection to Internet for all the other users. This method also implements the Automatic Kill Switch option and prevents possible DNS leaks. To access Transmission you will need nginx Reverse Proxy (even on local network). Configure Transmission for VPN Split Tunnel on Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 8 (including Minibian) Part 1 is to complete the guide Force Torrent Traffic through VPN Split Tunnel Debian 8 + Ubuntu 16.04 . If you have already configured Split Tunnel, then you can continue with this Part 2 guide to configure Transmission to use the VPN split tunnel. It is important that you have a working Split Tunnel on your server before you can proceed with configuring Transmission for VPN Split Tunneling, otherwise it will not work! Installation Overview Install Transmission Configure Transmission to use the VPN split tunnel Verify Transmission is using the VPN Configure the nginx reverse proxy to keep remote access of Transmission Important: This guide is written for Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS and Debian 8 systems (like Minibian, Raspbian, Bananian) that uses systemd services. It might work on other Linux distributions, but it is guaranteed to work on Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS and Debian 8. For Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS, upstart scripts are required instead of systemd services. If you are using Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS, jump to the Configure Transmission for VPN Split Tunneling on Ubuntu 14.x guide. Install Transmission BitTorrent Client Ubuntu 16.04 LTS After configuring the VPN Split Tunnel in Part 1, we need to install Transmission and configure it to run as the vpn user so that only the Transmission torrent traffic goes through the VPN connection. In case of Ubuntu Server 16.04 we will use the official Transmission PPA to make sure the latest Transmission version is installed. Note: If you are on Debian 8 (Minibian, Raspbian) then skip this part and go to the Debian 8 section of this guide. Add the Transmission Ubuntu repository sudo add-apt-repository ppa:transmissionbt/ppa Update packages and install Transmission sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install transmission-daemon -y Transmission is now installed, you can proceed to the Create Systemd Service Unit part of the guide. Install Transmission BitTorrent Client Debian 8 (Minibian, Raspbian) After Part 1 of the Split Tunnel VPN guide is completed, and you have a working VPN Split Tunnel configured on your system, it is time to install Transmission. On Debian 8 (Minibian, Raspbian) it is simple as the following apt-get update apt-get install transmission-daemon -y Create Systemd Service Unit First we need to modify the systemd service for transmission-daemon to run as the vpn user. Stop the Transmission service sudo systemctl stop transmission-daemon Next we will override the default systemd unit by creating a drop-in snippet which is applied on top of the original unit. It is the proper way to edit systemd unit files provided by packages. If Transmission is updated, the changes will remain and not be overwritten. Note: on Minibian you don't need to use sudo Create the required folder and conf file sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/transmission-daemon.service.d sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/transmission-daemon.service.d/local.conf Copy and paste the following content. This will ensure Transmission is run as vpn user, and that the Transmission service is started after the VPN tunnel ( tun0 ) is up. [Unit] After=sys-devices-virtual-net-tun0.device Wants=sys-devices-virtual-net-tun0.device [Service] User= User=vpn Group= Group=vpn Type=simple ExecStart= ExecStart=/usr/bin/transmission-daemon -f --log-error -g /etc/transmission-daemon Restart=on-failure RestartSec=10 Ctrl+X, Y and Enter to Save. Finally, reload systemd to scan for new and changed units sudo systemctl daemon-reload Configure Transmission for VPN Split Tunnel We are going to run Transmission as vpn user, therefore we need to change the ownership of the Transmission configuration files sudo chown -R vpn:vpn /etc/transmission-daemon/ Give the Transmission settings file write and execute permissions for the vpn user and group. sudo chmod -R 775 /etc/transmission-daemon/ I strongly recommend to create a download folder for your torrents and set the required permissions. In this example we will create a folder Downloads in the regular user's home directory, in our case it is htpcguides . Of course, you should modify the path to fit your setup replacing htpcguides with your username. Create the download folder if it doesn't already exist mkdir /home/htpcguides/Download Now set the permissions of your download folders sudo chown -R vpn:vpn /home/htpcguides/Download sudo chmod -R 775 /home/htpcguides/Download The rpc-whitelist setting specifies which IP addresses may access the Web interface. We are going to use an nginx reverse proxy to retain remote access to the Transmission web interface. With this method it is sufficient to limit access to the localhost only \u2013 the default value. This will work just fine as long as Transmission and nginx are running on the same server. In addition, it is much more secure since only localhost will have access to Transmission. Note: since we limit access to Transmission except the localhost (using iptables from the Part 1 of the guide), you can not access Transmission GUI even if you whitelist your home network range. You need to use nginx reverse proxy. Open up the Transmission configuration file for editing sudo nano /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json Change the remote access username and password to your liking \"rpc-password\": \"password\", \"rpc-username\": \"username\", Change the download directory to where you want to store your torrent downloads. By default it is /var/lib/transmission-daemon/downloads/ but if you created a new directory like described few lines before, make sure you enter that path. \"download-dir\": \"/home/htpcguides/Download\", Set umask to 002 to avoid permission issues, these are equal to 775 \"umask\": 002, Ctrl+X, Y and enter to save. Now you should start Transmission sudo systemctl start transmission-daemon.service Configure Transmission Remote Access with nginx Reverse Proxy At this point you should have a fully working VPN with Split Tunneling and a running Transmission client tunneled over the VPN connection. To access Transmission Web UI with a split tunnel you need to create a reverse proxy. The following section will show you how to configure nginx reverse proxy. Note this configuration uses plain, unencrypted http connection for nginx. If you plan to access Transmission from outside of your local network you should consider configuring nginx with a secure SSL certificate using our guide Secure nginx Reverse Proxy with Let\u2019s Encrypt , or alternatively you can configure with a self-signed certificate following the guide Enforce SSL for Secure nginx Reverse Proxy Linux (now that Let's Encrypt provides free valid certificates, I strongly recommend to use it). If you need access to Transmission (or other services) only from your local network, then you can use the following simple nginx configuration. Install nginx sudo apt-get install nginx -y Create a new nginx site sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse Add these lines, adjust your dynamic DNS address (mine is htpcguides.crabdance.com) and local IP address (mine is 192.168.40.100). If you changed your default Transmission port change 127.0.0.1:9091 to reflect your port. If you already have a reverse proxy virtual host configured then you only need to add the blue section. Note that the red curly bracket closes the server block so if you add more reverse proxies you will have to do so before the second curly bracket. server { listen 80; server_name htpcguides.crabdance.com, 192.168.40.100; location /transmission { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9091; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } Ctrl+X, Y and Enter to Save and exit Disable the default nginx site sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default Enable the reverse proxy site with Transmission enabled sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/reverse Restart the nginx service sudo service nginx restart Restart the transmission-daemon sudo systemctl restart transmission-daemon.service You can now access Transmission using the reverse proxy at http://ip.address/transmission or using your dynamic DNS address http://yourdns.address/transmission (Remember, you can access Transmission only through the nginx reverse proxy). To access it outside the home network you will need to forward port 80 or in your router to the machine hosting nginx but beware of security risks like brute force attacks ( guide ). You can use the local IP address from within your home network, but when accessing it outside the home network you need to use the dynamic DNS address. As already mentioned, if you want to access nginx from outside of your local network, don't use plain, unencrypted http connection, but configure a secure TLS/SSL nginx configuration by following the guide Secure nginx Reverse Proxy with Let\u2019s Encrypt Recommended Transmission Settings for Maximum Security In order to make sure that none of the services included in Transmission are going to leak your IP address, I recommend to set the following settings. These recommendations are based on discussions of various forums. While disabling these settings might somewhat reduce the number of peers you can connect to, it is better to keep them disabled to minimize the chance of leaking your IP (if you are using a private tracker, you should disable these options anyway). In Transmission Web UI go to Settings and Peer tab. Set Encryption mode to Require encryption , and uncheck PEX , DHT and LPD In the Network tab, the Peer listening port is closed, which will limit the number of available peers you can connect to, but opening the port over VPN is not recommended as it greatly reduces security. Some VPN providers offer port forwarding like PIA do, but it requires additional configuration and it is better to avoid opening ports in terms of security. However, for private trackers an open port might be required, stay tuned for a guide for port forwarding with PIA and VPN Split Tunnel. Make sure Enable uTP for peer communication is disabled. Confirm Transmission is Using VPN Split Tunnel We want to make sure that Transmission is using the VPN tunnel. A great way to do this is to download a torrent file from TorGuard . They have a great service called Check My Torrent IP Address. To download the torrent file click on Alternatively, you can Save Link Location in Firefox or Copy link address in Chrome and copy directly into Transmission's enter URL field. Note: the \u201cTracker returned an error message\u201d is normal. The important part is the IP address at the end of the line. It should be the VPN server's IP address. You can copy the IP address and check with IP Tracker. Just paste the IP address and the result should show you the location. Make sure it matches the VPN server's location you use (in our case it is Sweden). If the IP Lookup matches the VPN server's location, you successfully configured Transmission for VPN Split Tunneling. Resolve Permission Issues In Part 1 the VPN Split Tunnel guide we recommended to add your regular user to the vpn group, and to add vpn user to your regular user's group. It is important to avoid any permission related issues with the downloaded torrents. We configured Transmission's permissions for downloaded torrents to be fully accessible (read, write, execute) by vpn user and members of the vpn group. If you use automation software like Sonarr or CouchPotato, the user who is running these services should be added to the vpn group. If you run the automation software as your regular user then you should not need to make any further changes to permissions beyond what you did in Part 1. sudo usermod -aG vpn user-running-automation","title":"Configure Transmission for VPN Split Tunneling Ubuntu 16.04 + Debian 8 \u2022"},{"location":"uncategorized/Configure%20Transmission%20for%20VPN%20Split%20Tunneling%20Ubuntu%2016.04%20%2B%20Debian%208%20%E2%80%A2/#configure-transmission-for-vpn-split-tunnel-on-ubuntu-1604-and-debian-8-including-minibian","text":"Part 1 is to complete the guide Force Torrent Traffic through VPN Split Tunnel Debian 8 + Ubuntu 16.04 .

Step 2: Create CNAME Records In the \"Custom resource records\" section of your DNS settings, create the following DNS records: Subdomain DNS Configuration Record Type Host Value CNAME www <subdomain>.ghost.io A @ 178.128.137.126 Note: The A record will automatically redirect the http and https root domain to the subdomain you configure. Root Domain Configuration Google Domains does not support CNAME root domain configurations and using an A record to achieve a root domain is not supported. To setup a root domain configuration, we recommend that you consider using Cloudflare for additional flexibility. Step 3: Activate the Custom Domain Login to your publication's Ghost Admin area, and go to the Ghost(Pro) > Domain settings. Click the \u201cSetup\u201d button and follow the prompts to activate your custom domain.","title":"Google domain setup guide   Ghost(Pro)"},{"location":"uncategorized/Google%20domain%20setup%20guide%20-%20Ghost%28Pro%29/#step-1-access-domain-dns-settings","text":"The first step in setting up your custom domain is to sign into your Google Domains account and head over to your domain's DNS settings.","title":"Step 1: Access Domain DNS Settings****"},{"location":"uncategorized/Google%20domain%20setup%20guide%20-%20Ghost%28Pro%29/#step-2-create-cname-records","text":"In the \"Custom resource records\" section of your DNS settings, create the following DNS records: Subdomain DNS Configuration Record Type Host Value CNAME www <subdomain>.ghost.io A @ 178.128.137.126 Note: The A record will automatically redirect the http and https root domain to the subdomain you configure.

Other packages typically don't include their own man pages (nor other documentation). Rather, they provide an associated package that carries such stuff. For example: $ apk add curl $ man curl man: No entry for curl in the manual. $ apropos curl | wc -l 0 After adding curl, there are no man pages $ apk add curl-doc (1/1) Installing curl-doc (7.52.1-r2) Executing mandoc-apropos-1.13.3-r6.trigger OK: 60 MiB in 31 packages $ apropos curl | wc -l 366 Now, with curl-doc installed, there's a boatload of pages! NOTE: Not all packages separate out their documentation, but it is the Alpine Way (e.g. small footprint). Some packages don't provide any installable documentation at all, neither within themselves nor an associated doc packages. Further, appending \"-doc\" is merely a convention. In fact, the core man documentations are in man-pages (as in the apk add ... command, above). To find the right documentation package, try something like: $ apk search gcc | grep ^gcc gcc-objc-5.3.0-r0 gcc-gnat-5.3.0-r0 gcc-5.3.0-r0 gcc-java-5.3.0-r0 gcc-doc-5.3.0-r0 Here it is! FINALLY: If you're wondering why I've added less (and less-doc ), it's because man doesn't work correctly with more (the default pager). Don't fret too much about bloating up Alpine, though - adding man pages has a bigger footprint than less ( \"less is more than man\"??? ) If you would like documentation packages to be pulled in automatically you can add the docs meta package. Operational hints Shell @ commandline Alpine comes with busybox by default. Busybox is an endpoint for numerous symlinks for various utilities. Though busybox is not that bad, the commands are impaired in functionality. Funny characters at the console Edit the file at /etc/rc.conf and change line 92 to: unicode=\"YES\" Bash It is easy enough to have bash installed, but this does not mean the symlinks to busybox are gone. Install bash with: apk add bash bash-doc bash-completion Shell utilities (things like grep, awk , ls are all busybox symlinks) apk add util-linux pciutils usbutils coreutils binutils findutils grep /etc/{shadow,group} manipulation requires apk add shadow Disk Management Disk management is so much easier with udisks or udisks2 Installation apk add udisks2 udisks2-doc See the mounted disks udisksctl status Compiling : a few notes and a reminder Compiling in Alpine may be more challenging because it uses musl-libc instead of glibc.
